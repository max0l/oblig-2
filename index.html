                        World Mental Health Day is coming up on October 10! It’s a day celebrated in over 150 countries
                        to
                        spread
                        awareness about mental health. In Norway, we kick off a national public health campaign that
                        runs
                        from
                        weeks
                        39 to 42 each year. During this time, schools, workplaces, and organizations come together to
                        promote
                        understanding and openness about mental health.

                        This year, the World Health Organization (WHO) is teaming up with partners to highlight the
                        important
                        link
                        between mental health and work. Safe and healthy work environments can protect our mental
                        well-being. On
                        the
                        flip side, unhealthy conditions—like stigma, discrimination, and harassment—can really take a
                        toll
                        on
                        our
                        mental health and overall quality of life. With 60% of people around the world in jobs, it’s
                        crucial
                        that we
                        take action to create workplaces that support mental health.

                        To improve mental health at work, everyone needs to work together—governments, employers, worker
                        organizations, and others. It's important to include the voices of workers and those who have
                        experienced
                        mental health issues. By focusing on proven strategies and interventions, we can help create
                        environments
                        where everyone can thrive at work and in life.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Mental Health and Work: Mental health is closely tied to work. A supportive
                            workplace promotes mental well-being, while poor conditions can harm it, leading
                            to lower job satisfaction and productivity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Risks to Workers: Workers face various mental health risks, such as discrimination
                            and inadequate working conditions. Low-paid or insecure jobs often leave workers
                            more vulnerable to these risks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Impact on Individuals: Insufficient support for those with mental health conditions
                            can harm their confidence, job satisfaction, and ability to work. Family members
                            and caregivers are also affected.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wider Societal Impact: Poor mental health results in decreased performance and
                            higher absenteeism. Depression and anxiety alone cause about 12 billion workdays
                            lost each year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stigma and Employment: Stigma and discrimination can prevent individuals with
                            mental health conditions from seeking help or maintaining employment. Reducing
                            discrimination through awareness and training can create healthier work
                            environments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Supporting Workers: Employers should make reasonable accommodations for
                            workers with mental health conditions, such as regular check-ins and flexible
                            schedules.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Manager Training: Employers should train managers to recognize stressors and
                            support their teams effectively, fostering a healthier workplace
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Government Collaboration: Governments, employers, and worker organizations
                            must collaborate to create policies that promote well-being and prioritize mental
                            health
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Self-Care: While it's essential for employers and governments to promote mental
                            health, individuals can also take steps to care for their own well-being. Learn stress
                            management techniques and seek support from trusted sources when needed.
