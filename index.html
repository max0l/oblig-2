                    World Mental Health Day is coming up on October 10! It’s a day celebrated in over 150 countries to
                    spread
                    awareness about mental health. In Norway, we kick off a national public health campaign that runs
                    from
                    weeks
                    39 to 42 each year. During this time, schools, workplaces, and organizations come together to
                    promote
                    understanding and openness about mental health.

                    This year, the World Health Organization (WHO) is teaming up with partners to highlight the
                    important
                    link
                    between mental health and work. Safe and healthy work environments can protect our mental
                    well-being. On
                    the
                    flip side, unhealthy conditions—like stigma, discrimination, and harassment—can really take a toll
                    on
                    our
                    mental health and overall quality of life. With 60% of people around the world in jobs, it’s crucial
                    that we
                    take action to create workplaces that support mental health.

                    To improve mental health at work, everyone needs to work together—governments, employers, worker
                    organizations, and others. It's important to include the voices of workers and those who have
                    experienced
                    mental health issues. By focusing on proven strategies and interventions, we can help create
                    environments
                    where everyone can thrive at work and in life.

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Mental Health and Work: Mental health is closely tied to work. A supportive
                        workplace promotes mental well-being, while poor conditions can harm it, leading
                        to lower job satisfaction and productivity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Risks to Workers: Workers face various mental health risks, such as discrimination
                        and inadequate working conditions. Low-paid or insecure jobs often leave workers
                        more vulnerable to these risks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Impact on Individuals: Insufficient support for those with mental health conditions
                        can harm their confidence, job satisfaction, and ability to work. Family members
                        and caregivers are also affected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wider Societal Impact: Poor mental health results in decreased performance and
                        higher absenteeism. Depression and anxiety alone cause about 12 billion workdays
                        lost each year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stigma and Employment: Stigma and discrimination can prevent individuals with
                        mental health conditions from seeking help or maintaining employment. Reducing
                        discrimination through awareness and training can create healthier work
                        environments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Supporting Workers: Employers should make reasonable accommodations for
                        workers with mental health conditions, such as regular check-ins and flexible
                        schedules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manager Training: Employers should train managers to recognize stressors and
                        support their teams effectively, fostering a healthier workplace
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Government Collaboration: Governments, employers, and worker organizations
                        must collaborate to create policies that promote well-being and prioritize mental
                        health
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Self-Care: While it's essential for employers and governments to promote mental
                        health, individuals can also take steps to care for their own well-being. Learn stress
                        management techniques and seek support from trusted sources when needed.
