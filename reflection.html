                <h3>Evaluation of the Received Mock-up</h3>
                <p>We received the mock-up made by <span class="isBold">group 12</span>, and these are the observations we made
                    when
                    looking through their work:</p>
                <span class="isBold">Not so good</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>The instructions were a wall of text, and the information should be organized in a more
                        readable
                        manner.</li>
                    <li>The mock-up was hard to read. The writing was unclear as well as their english was a little hard
                        to understand. They only wrote using a pencil making it hard to read properly.
                        It would have been easier, had they used a black pen to write or provided a scanned version.</li>
                    
                    <li>Some of the instructions were unclear or not as precise as we needed. Thus, we had to
                        interpret and
                        guess what they wanted us to do. Example, the 'EVENTS' ought to be bold or a header, missing
                        description.
                        There's also a box around the text 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3, but no explanation on what this is.
                    </li>
                    <li>We were given a broad set of fonts to use, but some of them are not optimal for user
                        readability,
                        breaking the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> rules.
                        Even though fonts like Times New Roman are widely used, they present problems for
                        accessibility.
                        To make the site accessible to a majority of users, a sans-serif font where letters like 'a'
                        and 'e'
                        have large enough openings (apertures) to be distinguishable is important.</li>
                    <li>Some of the other issues we found lacking:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Top Nav Bar: what color? "Free to choose" is not a good description.</li>
                            <li>They said to add a margin to make it aesthetically pleasing, but where do we add it?
                            </li>
                            <li>Where is the 8-16px margin applied? Is it the absolute value or on both sides?</li>
                            <li>Opening links in new tabs was not stated but added.</li>
                            <li>Where should the first nav bar link lead to? Hashtag or text one? → We made it to
                                text one.</li>
                            <li>What are those boxes? Should the content only contain them, or should they also be
                                present? If yes, what color?</li>
                            <li>What to do with 11.10?</li>
                            <li>They said to make the "title" bold for text 12.1, but they don't specify how. Do we use
                                HTML or CSS?
                                We decided on using CSS to make them bold.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>We felt like the hyphon was hard to implement and not really necessary for the website.</li>
                    <li>The design of the site is more of a Grid layout than Flex (we managed to miss the small text
                        about not using Grid, our fault), we had to tinker a bit to get the code to work.</li>
                    <li>
                        We had a problem finding a way to include the nth-child pseudo-class or find where to add it.
                        So we added a gradient to the List items of the Text 11.X to create a wave effect using gradient
                        and nth-child pseudo-class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had to use absulote positioning for the Navbar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had to use relative positioning for the card layouts for the events.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <span class="isBold">Good</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many values given for various sizes.</li>
                    <li>They made a desktop version of the mock-up</li>
                    <li>Included a fixed navbar making it more organized</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To address the issues, we modified the font choices to more accessible sans-serif fonts,
                    organized the information in clearer sections, and added descriptions where missing. We used
                    absolute positioning in some areas to place elements more precisely where needed, especially for
                    navigation and boxes around sections.</p>

                <p><span class="isBold">Rating:</span> We rate the effectiveness of the received mock-up a 3/5.</p>

                <h3>Self-Assessment of Your Own Mock-up</h3>
                <p>We, <span class="isBold">group 16</span>, have done our own assessment.</p>

                <span class="isBold">Not so good</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our mock-up did not have any navigation tool, so navigating back and forth the newsletter
                        could be challenging.</li>
                    <li>We did not create a sketch mock-up for the desktop version of our website. This
                        could have made it harder
                        for the group that got our mock-up to design it like we visioned it to be.</li>
                    <li>We might be too minimalist in our approach to make a really interesting site design wise.</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="isBold">Good</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our fonts are sans-serif fonts, chosen mainly for their readability.</li>
                    <li>We've chosen a minimalist design approach to ensure clarity and simplicity for users.</li>
                    <li>We had the developer in mind, thus we tried to make a design that wouldn't be too hard to code
                        for a junior developer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In our assessment our mock-up met the objectives well, of couse some areas could have been
                    clearer.</p>

                <p><span class="isBold">Rating:</span> We rate our own mock-up a 4/5.</p>

                <h3>Sustainability Assessment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converted all images to <abbr title="Web Picture">.webp</abbr>, a file format designed for
                        the
                        web. The file format has a better compression rate than, for example, .png or .jpg, saving
                        up to
                        24-36% in bandwidth.</li>
                    <li>Before converting to .webp, the pictures for the logos used 104 KB. After conversion, they
                        were 57.3
                        KB.</li>
                    <li>We used a limited color palette, reducing bandwidth load. Our palette consists of medium
                        intensity
                        colors, including a mid-range purple and gray background, balancing design needs with
                        sustainability.</li>
                    <li>Using standard fonts available on most systems reduces the need for the local machine to
                        download
                        and install extra fonts, saving bandwidth and storage on both the host and the client.</li>
                    <li>For the background image. We have taken a part of a picture, converted it to a .webp and only
                        used a small bit of the picture with a repeating pattern. The Pictue was 30kB when it was a png.
                        After converting it to the webp format, it was only 14kB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since we are using Times new Roman as a font, we dont have to include it/ship it to the end
                        user, because it is a websafe font. This means it is preinstalled on most of the devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We reduced to font file size of the helvetica font from 311KB to 19KB (in the smallest form factor: woff2).
                    </li>
                </ul>
