- What should the background color be?
- Top Nav Bar: what color? "Free to choose" is not a good description.
- Where is the 8-16px margin applied, is it the absolute value or on both sides?
- What are those boxes? Should the content only contain it or should they also be present? If yes, what color?
- Opening links in new tabs was not stated but added.
- What to do with 11.10?

Good:
- There are many values given for various sizes

    <h3>Evaluation of the Received Mock-up</h3>
    <p>We received the mock-up made by <strong>group 12</strong>, and these are the observations we made when looking through their work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The instructions were a wall of text, and the information should be organized in a more readable manner.</li>
        <li>Some of the instructions were unclear or not as precise as we needed. Thus, we had to interpret and guess what they wanted us to do.</li>
        <li>We were given a broad set of fonts to use, but some of them are not optimal for user readability,
            breaking the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> rules.
            Even though fonts like Times New Roman are widely used, they present problems for accessibility.
            To make the site accessible to a majority of users, a sans-serif font where letters like 'a' and 'e' have large enough openings (apertures) to be distinguishable is important.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Self-Assessment of Your Own Mock-up</h3>

    <p>We, <strong>group 16</strong>, have done our own assessment.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Our fonts are sans-serif fonts, chosen mainly for their readability.</li>
        <li>We've chosen a minimalist design approach to ensure clarity and simplicity for users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sustainability Assessment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Converted all images to <dfn><abbr title="Web Picture">.webp</abbr>, a file format designed for the web. The file format has a better compression rate than, for example, .png or .jpg, saving up to 24-36% in bandwidth.</li>
        <li>Before converting to .webp, the pictures for the logos used 104 KB. After conversion, they were 57.3 KB.</li>
        <li>We used a limited color palette, reducing bandwidth load. Our palette consists of medium intensity colors, including a mid-range purple and gray background, balancing design needs with sustainability.</li>
        <li>Using standard fonts available on most systems reduces the need for the local machine to download and install extra fonts, saving bandwidth and storage on both the host and the client.</li>
    </ul>
